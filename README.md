## Python Analysis & Data Cleaning

Python was used as the first step to prepare the data for SQL analysis. Key steps included:
- **Data Loading & Exploration:** Checked data structure, column types, and basic statistics.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Filled missing Review Rating values using category-wise median.
- **Column Cleaning & Standardization:** Lowercased column names, replaced spaces with underscores, and renamed columns for consistency.
- **Age Group Categorization:** Binned customer ages into meaningful groups (Young Adult, Adult, Middle Age, Senior).
- **Purchase Frequency Mapping:** Converted purchase frequency labels (e.g., Daily, Weekly) into numeric days for analysis.
- **Dropped Unnecessary Columns:** Removed irrelevant columns such as promo_code_used. 
- **Data Upload to SQL:** Cleaned data was uploaded to MySQL for further SQL analysis.

> The full Python code for data cleaning and preparation is available in the repository as `Customer_datacleaning.ipynb`
